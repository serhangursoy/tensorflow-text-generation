This is a simple text generation code purely based on the tutorial on the Tensorflow page. In the future, I'm planning to add more examples.

## About Dataset

Mustafa Kemal Ataturk is one of the most important figures in Modern Turkish History.
He was a Turkish field marshal, revolutionary statesman, author, and founder of the Republic of Turkey.
His leadership undertook sweeping progressive reforms, which modernized Turkey into a secular, industrial nation.
Even though many Turkish people have deep knowledge or at least familiarity with his ideology, there is no doubt that hearing those ideas from his "way"
of speech is more valuable and important.

Therefore, using speech samples from such an important figure felt like the right thing to do. I wanted to use this chance and use my test-dataset as Mustafa Kemal Ataturk's speech data.

Feel free to use this data in any project you want.

## Requirements

Make sure that you have Python 3.x and Tensorflow installed on your machine.

    $ pip install --upgrade pip
    $ pip install tensorflow

## Run

In order to start, simply run this command ( might be different depending on your OS and Python version )
    $ python text_generation.py

## Output

Based on your input folder and CPU/GPU, you will see the output in same folder with name generated_output.txt

## Customize

To customize parameters, go to text_generation.py and edit MAIN_PARAMS accordingly.
